# PCA-and-Association-Rules

This project contains 2 parts. 

For the first part, you should implement PCA (Principle Components Analysis) algorithm, project the high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and plot the 2-dimensional data points. 

For the second part, you need to implement Apriori algorithm and rule generation algorithm.
